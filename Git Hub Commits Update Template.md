### Git Hub Commits update template:

Working on ER diagram with different tables and relationshops between them. Moreover, gathering requirements for technical stack for the project and doing a research to integrate maps with the application.

Working on UX/UI design. Designing the user interface(preliminary visual mock-up) for the application. 

We as a team worked together on Database schema and completed few ER diagrams related to Login, Register page

Doing a research on apis to append and integrate maps with the web application.

As a team we worked on the prototype of the project we created some of the entity diagrams and looking farward to come up with full schema of the project

Working more on the ER diagrams and relationships among them for the full databse schema and gathering the technical information.

This week we sat as a team and designed the UI interface design pages document with login page, register page, rider page and driver page. We had a sketch of front user interface.

we have created few ER diagrams for login, register, master pages and planning to complete the remaining ER diagrams for other tables.

In this mid week, we sat as team worked on database schema with ER diagrams with relationships with required tables. Further weeks will implement the database.

I have done a bit of research on google maps Api's.

1. Google is now requiring a proper API key for accessing the service. can Create a key, or create/find an existing one in your Google Developers Console.
2. [Api Key documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)
3. There are different ways to use the map apis as per our requirement and the technical stack we use.
4. API Support
   Currently the library supports full coverage of the following Google Maps APIs:
   * Geocoding
   * Elevation
   * Static Maps
   * Dynamic Maps
   * Directions
   * Distance Matrix
   * Places
   * Time Zones
   * Street View

Added relations to all the tables and discussed how to maintain the log tables in future with team


Created the relationships between the tables in the ER- Diagram and working to implement the complete database schema. While developing the application, based on the performance, we may have split the main table to multiple sub tables. Some more log tables need to be created to maintain and track all the changes.

Since, we designed ER schema last week. Now, we have completed relationships between the entities. Any required changes will be done after the review.

We created relationships among the tables and one important point is we may have to split the main table into multiple tables based on the performance efficiency.

As a team we discussed related to reports(Rider Report, Driver Report) and added those 2 reports in prototype

We have created a Trello Board(To Do List) in github repo with in the project and wiki page has been created. Moreover, we have included reports page for rider & driver with in the prototype.

In this sprint did a research on integrating the google maps api with web applications. Checked with API and the library that supports the web application. [Here is the resource](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map). Looking insights of Collaborative Realtime Mapping with Firebase, Geolocation: Displaying User or Device Position on Maps, Adding a Map and Markers to a React Application and Marker Clustering.

we added reports page to the prototype like rider report and driver report. So that there is a clear count on ride given and ride requested from both driver and rider respectively.

Completed protoype of Database Schema with all the relationships. 

Added relations to the tables, need to implement few log tables and also discussed regarding spliting the main tables based on performance. Trying to install Visual Studio 2017.


We want to build the user interface (UI) pages based on our prototype, and we'll do everything we can to create the right pages for the login page, registration page, and driver page.

Login page UI has been finished. working on register page and at the same time looking on functionality part between the pages.

Developed UI pages. Used CSS, HTML, Java Script for designing login pages. Need to make login page functional and establish a connection between driver and rider pages.

Helped team in adding references in project. Downloaded JS libraries

Took help form peers and Installed Microsoft SSMS for database connection and made the connection with project successfully.

Successfully installed the microsoft sql server management studio and created the database and the connection was made successfully with the project.
