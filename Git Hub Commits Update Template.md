This week we sat as a team and designed the UI interface design pages document with login page, register page, rider page and driver page. We had a sketch of front user interface.

we have created few ER diagrams for login, register, master pages and planning to complete the remaining ER diagrams for other tables.

In this mid week, we sat as team worked on database schema with ER diagrams with relationships with required tables. Further weeks will implement the database.

I have done a bit of research on google maps Api's.

1. Google is now requiring a proper API key for accessing the service. can Create a key, or create/find an existing one in your Google Developers Console.
2. [Api Key documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)
3. There are different ways to use the map apis as per our requirement and the technical stack we use.
4. API Support
   Currently the library supports full coverage of the following Google Maps APIs:
   * Geocoding
   * Elevation
   * Static Maps
   * Dynamic Maps
   * Directions
   * Distance Matrix
   * Places
   * Time Zones
   * Street View

Added relations to all the tables and discussed how to maintain the log tables in future with team


Created the relationships between the tables in the ER- Diagram and working to implement the complete database schema. While developing the application, based on the performance, we may have split the main table to multiple sub tables. Some more log tables need to be created to maintain and track all the changes.

Since, we designed ER schema last week. Now, we have completed relationships between the entities. Any required changes will be done after the review.

We created relationships among the tables and one important point is we may have to split the main table into multiple tables based on the performance efficiency.

As a team we discussed related to reports(Rider Report, Driver Report) and added those 2 reports in prototype
